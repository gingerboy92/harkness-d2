# Using the "Issues" Tab #

When submitting an issue, it is recommended to include relevant logging data for improved support.

Documentation on gathering debug info can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/tegraowners-ics-rom/wiki/How_to_get_logs).

Third party applications, such as [SysLog](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tortel.syslog), can make this task significantly easier.

Note:
  * To debug a problem while the kernel is currently running, a dmesg is recommended.
  * To debug an issue that causes reboots/power-downs, a last\_kmsg should gather the information from before the last power-down.

` To request feature(s) be submitted to CyanogenMod(CM), simply mark your issue as "Review" and describe what should be pushed upstream. (Commits on GitHub marked TEST are in testing for submission to CM's code review) `
